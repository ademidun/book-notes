# Chaos Monkeys: Behind the scenes of Goldman Sachs, Facebook and Y Combinator

- Antonio Garcia Martineze might be the bravest author I have ever read.
- I am blown away by how honest and transparent he is in the book

- usually when you read a book about a company like Goldman Sachs or Facebook or Y Combinator, it's by a journalist who can be honest but often lacks insider insight
- Or an ex-employee that is either very jaded  and biased or plays it safe and says nothing ineresting in fears of burning bridges

- AGM, has both insight because he was involved in all companies in a meaningful way (Trade at Goldman during financial crisis, CEO of a YC company in 2010, and Product Manager of Ads at Facebook)
- And I was literally blown away by how transparent he was about his experiencees at all the companies and he actually called people by their names
- I also like how he sprinkles startup lessons and advice throughout the book

- (parphrasing) just because someone is doing well in the first quarter, or down in the first quarter, that doesn't mean that's how they will finish the game [95]

- He also validates my hypothesis that if you enjoy reading someone's tweets, there is a a very strong chance you will enjoy any books they've writeen so go follow him [tk add his twitter username]

- Funny Chapter title: Startup Founders is like Marriage but without the "fun part" [87]
- Interesting insight into pitching at Sequoia and their professionalism [125]
