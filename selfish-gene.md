## The Selfish Gene

- Book about how our gene is the primary driver of almost everything in modern day philosophy
- Spectacular opening by Dawkins, I think he's the type of person many people would consider "arrogant" if you care about that typeof stuff (e.g. if you overindex on Arrogance (tk link to tweet) )  but I find him very intelligent, confident and witty
- "These are claims that could have been made for Lorenz's On Agression, Adrey's The Social Contract and Eibl-Eibesfeldt's Love and Hate. The trouble with these books is that their authors got it totally and utterly wrong. They got it wrong because they misunderstood how evolution works" [2]
- Very similiar writinh style to Nassim Taleb
- "If I say that I am more interested in preventing the slaughter of large whales than I am in improving hosing conditions for people. I am likely to shock some of my friends." So true, I know a lot of people from university that care more about helping animals than they care about helping people. [12]
- Very interesting theory about how people claim to be altruistic, but altruism at one level can become selfishness at another, (e.g. people may be altruistic to their own family but selfish towards their community) or "altruistic" towards people of their own race or religion but selfish towards others [12]
- Compares that to biolgy and trying to determine at what level are genese selfish vs. altruistic [11, 13]
- Are my genes trying to ensure the survival of that specific gene, of myself, of people with my genes, of the entire species, of all mammals? etc.
- "A human foetus [sic], with no more human feeling than an amoeba, enjoys a reverence and legal protection far in excess of those granted to an adult chimpanzee", even though a chimpanzee feels, thinks and can learn a form of human language [13]
- Dawkins adds that "wether the ethic of 'specisim' to use Richard Ryder's term can be put on a logical footing any more sound than that of 'racism', I do not know. What I do know is that it has no proper basis in evolutionary biology". I am not sure what Dawkins is saying here and at first I thought he was saying that racism is okay because we are biologically inclined to prefer people like us. But I think he is just raising the question of what is the threshold for people saying "this fetus is of the human species like me so we must protect it at all costs" versus 
"this person is also of the human species but is of a differnt race so they worth less than my race" [13]
- Very interesting question with no easy answers

- Then he starts to go deep into biology
## The Replicators
- Darwin's survival of the fittest is actually survival of the stable [15]


## Immortal Coils
- DNA molecule is a chain of nucleotides
- When you are first created one of dad's sperm and one of mom's eggs combine together
- each cell in your body has 46 chromosomes 23 from dad and 23 from mom [31]
- cells divide in a process called mitosis, where each cell has an identical cell of 46 chromosomes [33]
- there is another kind called meiosis, occuring only in production of sex cells, sperm and egg are unique because they are the only cells with 23 chromosomes, "exactly half of 46, which is convenient for fusing together in sexual fertilization to make an individual" [33]
- meiosis is a special kind of division in testicles and ovaries where a set of 46 chromosomes divides to a cell with only 23
- definition of a gene [36]
- genes can live for millions of years [45]
- A part of me feels like this is cool, but his definition of is so expansive that it almost just seems like either a truism or a trivial fact, though he humurously admits so himself [36
- gene is the basic unit of selfishnss [46]
Funny line "Everybody knows that wheat plants grow bigger in the presence of nitrate than it's absence
