# How to be a Capitalist without Any Capital by Nathan Latka

- If Tim Ferriss Wrote the four hour work week in 2019 as a millenial this would be the book he would write

- One thing I really admire about him is his transparency and he shows his numbers of how much money he makes and spends, more personal finance writers should do thi
- Shows a picture of his tax return [6]

- The book wasn't quite as useful for me because I have already read so much about Entrepreneurship that there wasn't much that I didn't already know
- This is one of those books that has a lot of useful "hacks"
- How to travel hack etc.
- While this can be useful for some people, honestly I try to focus on more sustainable ways of building wealth
- My theory is that the amount of time people put into optimizing travel rewards, they could probably put that into increasing their revenue and still come out ahead
- I've always felt like microptimizations like credit card rewards make a negligible effect on building long term wealth
- the best way to build wealth is by providing value to people and make something that people want
- if you do this enough you don't have to worry about "hacking" credit cards to get a free hotel when you travel, you can just have enough money pay for a nice hotel

- Some interesting insights however:

- Extremely detailed and well-written section on how to outsource [41]

- I found it very interesting how he alludes to Software Private equity being his next big move [249]

- I am also bullish on technology/software private equity, I actually took a private equity course in business school (course review coming sooon (subscribe to my blog)[https://blog.tomiwa.ca/subscribe/] ) to get notified when it comes out)

- I remember reading a stat somewhere that the best performing private equity firms were technology/software focused: Vista Equity partners led the group (maybe this is cyclical) but there's a lot of untapped opportunity in software still. It feels like we are at peak SAAS but sometimes it seems like we have barely even scratched surface.

- Software is highest productivity part of almost every modern economy, smart move by Nathan Latka

- I also like this because in the book he is looking at a lot of nano-cap  companies (company is worth less than $50 million )
- Smart because there are more deals to be found due to mispricing arbitrage of small companies
- It's easier for beginners to start by investing in small companies [151]

- Offers a lot of interesting insights on how to watch your competitors are doing and how to learn from them (similar web, todoist, ahrefs, semrush, siftery) [214]
- Every three months, randomly send an email to people you are paying for a service and say: "I need to find a cheaper option. I can't afford this anymore. Can you help me cancel my account?" [234]
- Pros and cons of using fear to negotiate [73]

- Really good and deatailed advice on how to invest in Real Estate [121]

Final Comments 

- I can't tell if this book is not meant for me at my current stage in life (e.g. I am not currently in a position to buy a house or a software company)

- It doesn't really have a clear narrative structure, which can be confusing at times to follow, seems more like a collection of essays.

- I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the topics of the book and the lack of a clear structure, though I can't tell if that is due to how Nathan Latka wrote the book or I was in a distracted state of mind reading about 2 other books at the same time (I don't recommend)

- Overall, a lot of very actionable insights in this book especially if you are looking for different ways to improve your wealth, especially if you don't have a lot of money right now.
