# The Attention Merchants by Tim Wu

Human attention is arguably the most precious commodity in modern history. This book looks at the history of how people have tried to get human attention.

I really like historical books because studying history is one of the best things you can do for pattern recognition and understanding the world better. It's very easy to get overwhelmed with the latest controversy du jour, but putting things in a historical context gives you a better understanding of what's really happening.

Tim Wu, does a really good job with this book and it's incredibly well researched.

Though, I would have liked to see a bit more humor or sarcasm in his writing. To be fair, I usually don't say this in most book reviews since I read almost exclusively non-fiction but since I just read Klosterman's but What if We're Wrong, the bar for writing style in non-fiction has been raised.

- Book starts very strong. Tells the story of a company EFP, Education Funding Partners that approaches the Twin Rivers school disctrict in 2011 that they will give money to struggling school district in exchange for money. Also tell the story of a company in Florida that put the McDonalds logo on its report card (good grades qualified you for a report card)[4]
- Funny enough I actually pitched this idea to a company I worked for before
- I think my high school had a Canada Dry Logo in our gymnasium
- But the book's strong opening frames the problem very well. The human mind is an extremely valuable resource that both people and arganizations want to access.
- Benjamin day invented ad-supported media at the age of 23 [10]

- Snake oil salesmen used to literally sell Snake Oil as medical thing that would cure all diseases
- Monotheistic religions demand the undivided attention of their believers [26]

# Demand Engineering, Scientific Advertising, and What Women Want

- Advertisers realized that if they want to get people to buy their products, they need to actually focus on the women
- Tangentially, I've also realized that when I run Facebook ads for Atila. After the campaign ends, I look at the analytics and often we get better engagement from females
