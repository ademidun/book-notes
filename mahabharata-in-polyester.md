- I am very optimistic about the future of India. For example, I have written about [What China and Nigeria can Learn from India](https://blog.tomiwa.ca/the-indian-model-what-china-and-nigeria-can-learn-from-india/) all the way back in 2016.

- When I read that Mukesh Ambani and Reliance were making "almost free"/really cheap internet available to most areas in India I knew this was going to unlock a lot of growth in the Indian economy
- I also have a lot of Indian friends and I think, lowkey, a big motivation for reading this book is to tease them that I know more about India's business landscape than they do.

- I actually didn't finish the book because while I found the story interesting, I am trying to read more books that are more directly related to my line of work (e.g. technolgy, sales, marketting and business strategy). I also was hoping to hear more about Mukesh and Anil, especially Mukesh.

- That sibling story is very interesting. Mukesh is worth $70 billion, according to Wikipedia Anil is worh $0 and $300 million in debt. 
- I'm sure the book will get to that (at least briefly), but I have put it on pause for now and I might back to it later.


Here are my notes on what I have read so far:

- History of the Gujarati people and their business roots [13]
- Anecdotally, many of the Gujarati people I know are very smart business people
- Whenever I read historical books it's always interesting to reflect on how "popular" socialism and communism "used to be"
- I often take it for granted that capitalism is the natural state of things but like Will and Ariel Durant said in The Lessons of History, society tends to oscillate between extrems,
- For example, some parts in human society people are super religious, other times they are more secular, likewise, sometimes society is more capitalist and other times they are more socialist, and usually society is at one end of the spectrum, people take things too far and then there is pushback/counter culture and the whole thing repeats itself
- Apparently Dhirubhai was a passionate socialist in his youth and now he is one of the textbook examples of a capitalist in India, this actually seems relatively common[18]

- Auguat 1947, British India plans to seperate along Hindu/Muslim lines: Kashmir, Hyderabad, Janegadh (spelling?) (Ambhani's region) are the three standout cases after "freedom at midnight" [19]

- In summer 2019, months before reading this book and over 50 years later since the events on page 19, Kashmir is still experiencing religious conflicts on this same issue

- Dhirubhai Ambani seen as an outsider by the Bombay "old money" elites: Godhej, Wadia, Singanias [83]
- Also seen as an outsider because he is Gujarati
- Dhirubhai got favorable import/custom privileges [76]

- Once they amde so many shell companies, Vinod asked him to name all the new host companies, Ambani told him to use Vishnu Sahasra Nam (The 1000 names of Vishnu)

- Their business model was Highly dependent on promoting a high share price, changed the accounting reporting period 4 times in 15 years [87]
- Threatened to withdraw advertising as a way to control the press [91]
- One thing that Ambani actually did very well was not just managing the government, but also managing the media
- This seems to be a less talked about but very important skill for succesful people: "controlling the narrative"
- People would sacrifice a salary and even pay to work at financial newspapers becuase the potential money they could make from bribes was so high [92]
