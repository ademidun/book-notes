- I am very optimistic about the future of India. For example, I have written about [What China and Nigeria can Learn from India](https://blog.tomiwa.ca/the-indian-model-what-china-and-nigeria-can-learn-from-india/) all the way back in 2016.

- When I read that Mukesh Ambani and Reliance were making "almost free"/really cheap internet available to most areas in India I knew this was going to unlock a lot of growth in the Indian economy
- I also have a lot of Indian friends and I think, lowkey, a big motivation for reading this book is to tease them that I know more about India's business landscape than they do.

- I actually didn't finish the book because while I found the story interesting, I am trying to read more books that are more directly related to my line of work (e.g. technolgy, sales, marketting and business strategy). I also was hoping to hear more about Mukesh and Anil, especially Mukesh.

- That sibling story is very interesting. Mukesh is worth $70 billion, according to Wikipedia Anil is worh $0 and $300 million in debt. 
- I'm sure the book will get to that (at least briefly), but I have put it on pause for now and I might back to it later.


Here are my notes on what I have read so far:
