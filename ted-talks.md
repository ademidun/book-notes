# TED TALKS: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking by Chris J. Anderson


- Importance of sharing ideas
## Chris Anderson Seems Really Cool

- I really respect Chris Anderson after reading the first chapter of the book
- He avoids using too many fluff words and cuts straight to the point
- I also like that he seems to be very high on opennes, he talks about how he's delighted when lots of TEDX conferences happen across the world because the goal is not to have a monopoly on ideas

- Richard Turere's story of building a Lion fence in Kenya


- Calls out men for often talking for hours without saying anything and that conversely women often undervalue their work
    - As a man, I can tell you, while it's a tough pill to swallow, Chris is right
- Gives the advice of how people can undervalue how many insightful things they have to say, to overcome this have honest conversations with those who know you best. Reminds me of the advice I gave in Ray Dalio's Principles (tk add link to book review)


## Raw Notes [tk: clean them up later]

Ted Talks by Chris Anderson

- the only criteria for giving a great talk is having something worth saying
- his motivational style is very practical
- I like how he motivates people who thinks they have nothing to talk about
- The Org Bore - Don't just talk about the company, talk about something that is useful for the company

Chapter 4
- when answering "tell me about yourself" pick a particular story from a point in your life that best encapsulates who you are, then unpack that story
- think about your talk not as an issue but about an idea [20:00]
- June Cohen: issue based talks lead with morality, idea based talks lead with curiosity
- instead of saying "isn't this terrible" frame it as "isn't this interesting"
- instead of framing it as a terrible problem that needs to be solved, frame it as an intriguing puzzle or riddle 
- first feels like an ask, second  feels like a gift, 
- laurence lessig, Lesterland and lobbying parable

Chapter 7 - explanations

Step1: start where your audience is, dontske daunting assumptions about audience knowledge
Step 2: lit the curiosity fire
Step 3: he brought in concepts one by one
Step 4: Used metaphors and analogies, build connections with new facts and existing mental model
Step 5: Used examples. Little stories help lock the idea into the brain.

Erin Mckeen: To explain JavaScript people often have mental model executed one after another. Javascript is async line 5ight not happen after line 4.

It's like getting dressed and putting on jacket before your shirt

Dan Palotta, Charity reformer- the way we think about charities handicaps charities

Promote companies to take risks but frown on non-profits
Uses combination of if-then statements and QED
Use reduction ad absurdum, show how strange the counter argument is to prove your point
Frown on high salaries for non-profit leader
Take audience on a detective journey
People can be convinced by logic but they're not energized by it so in addition to reason you have to use other tools


Revelation
Humans have a rare skill that others don't have, Ability to pattern the world in our mind for something that doesn't yet exist and bring it to reality


Chapter 10 - visuals
the point of slides is not to communicate words your mouth can already do that the point of the slides is to show visuals  that you can't explain orally
Chapter 11 scripting 

A scripted talk can feel like a pre-recorded game and the commentary has been added after the game has finished.

A good rule of thumb is can you give your talk while doing another activity. If you can give a talk while doing another mentally engaging activity that's how you know you have it fully memorized. 

Look for friendly faces in the audience to build confidence
