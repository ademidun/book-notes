# TED TALKS: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking by Chris J. Anderson


- Importance of sharing ideas
## Chris Anderson Seems Really Cool

- I really respect Chris Anderson after reading the first chapter of the book
- He avoids using too many fluff words and cuts straight to the point
- I also like that he seems to be very high on opennes, he talks about how he's delighted when lots of TEDX conferences happen across the world because the goal is not to have a monopoly on ideas
