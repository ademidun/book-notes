# Alchemy

I discovered this book through the recommended tab on Youtube and the comments below were so effusive in their praise that someone mentioned he had a book out and headed straight to Amazon.

I distinctly remember the review that caused me to buy the book, it said: "fans of Charli Munger and Nassim Taleb would enjoy this book". Say no more. The fact that this person compared it to my two favorite authors, I was immediately sold.

- The general thesis of the book is that humans did not evolve to understand objective reality but we evolved to survive
- One of the most compelling arguements he makes in the book is that often we try to improve something objectively when we would be better off improving it psyhologically.
- A perfect example of this is a plane or train trip. A company or government could spend billions of dollars to make a trip objectively 20% better: 
    - a 5 hr trip, 30  minutes shorter
    - It would actually be more beneficial to make the trip 20% psychologically better, by introducing free wifi on the train
- People are good at knowing that they are upset, but not very good at parsing, WHY they are upset. The reaons we give are often post-hoc rationalizations
- Like I've mentioned elsewhere, I have read so many books on human spychology this is already a well known fact to me but the stories he has are very interesting
- For example, when you have a technician coming to visit, and they give you a 3 hour window that they are coming in
- People say they don't like it because they have to take time off work, but really what they don't like is the uncertainty. We all know, that immediately you enter the shower that's when they knock on your door
- Much better if they just texted you when they finished with their last client and they're 40 minutes away so you can plan accordingly
- "The trouble with market research is that people don't think what they feel, they don't say what they think and they don't do what they say" [54]

## Be Careful with Maths

- Makes an intersting point about how in life 1 x 10 is not the same as 10 x 1.
- For example 1 person having to stand up in a train 10 times is not the same as 10 people having to stand on a train once, in the context of overcrowded trains and regular travelers vs seasonal travelers [90] [92]
- Then he makes a very strange e-commerce is good if 10 people wants to get the same thing but not good if 1 person wants to get 10 different things
- The worst part was this sentence: "Amazon can be a very big business selling one thing to 4 people, but if it can't sell 47 things to one person, there's a celing to how large it can be" [93]
- An absolutely shocking claim. I literally had to check the publication date 
- me: "there is no way he could have said this in 2019. Maybe it's one of those 'Amazon.bomb' articles from the 90s *I thought to myself optimistically
- What makes this take more strange is that I have watched a lot of his talks and he is vert intelligent and thoughftul, I still can't believe he said that
- I have tweeted him [tk send tweet and add a link] to explain that passage, I will update with his response
