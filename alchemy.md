# Alchemy

I discovered this book through the recommended tab on Youtube and the comments below were so effusive in their praise that someone mentioned he had a book out and headed straight to Amazon.

I distinctly remember the review that caused me to buy the book, it said: "fans of Charli Munger and Nassim Taleb would enjoy this book". Say no more. The fact that this person compared it to my two favorite authors, I was immediately sold.

- The general thesis of the book is that humans did not evolve to understand objective reality but we evolved to survive
- One of the most compelling arguements he makes in the book is that often we try to improve something objectively when we would be better off improving it psyhologically.
- A perfect example of this is a plane or train trip. A company or government could spend billions of dollars to make a trip objectively 20% better: 
    - a 5 hr trip, 30  minutes shorter
    - It would actually be more beneficial to make the trip 20% psychologically better, by introducing free wifi on the train
- People are good at knowing that they are upset, but not very good at parsing, WHY they are upset. The reaons we give are often post-hoc rationalizations
- Like I've mentioned elsewhere, I have read so many books on human spychology this is already a well known fact to me but the stories he has are very interesting
- For example, when you have a technician coming to visit, and they give you a 3 hour window that they are coming in
- People say they don't like it because they have to take time off work, but really what they don't like is the uncertainty. We all know, that immediately you enter the shower that's when they knock on your door
- Much better if they just texted you when they finished with their last client and they're 40 minutes away so you can plan accordingly
- "The trouble with market research is that people don't think what they feel, they don't say what they think and they don't do what they say" [54]
