The Greatest Trade Ever by Gregory Zuckerman

- The Greatest Trade Ever is about the 2007/2008 financial crisis and some of the people who made a little bit and a lot of money

- I read this book in February 2020 and I am just getting to it now in May 8 2020, 7 weeks into Covid-19 Quaranting, when a lot of people are trying to decide if now is a good time to buy stocks

- Rereading my notes from this book, I am further convinced that 2008 financial crisis and Covid 19 are drastically different and one should not draw too many conclusions

Some high level takeaways from this book:

- It's not enough to be right, you need to be right at the right time in a very specific way


## Notes

- When you find a great opportunity, be aggressive [90] [95], this is something that Charlie Munger also often says
- Credit Default Swaps have asymettric payoffs. Just like insurance, worst case scenario you pay 1-3% of assets in premium, but if stock price falls you can make 100X your premium payments. Such asymettric payoffs, also exist, e.g entrepreneurship and working for a startup. When you find a good way, take a bet on it [81]

- Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent [99]
- Meta-point about how ability to predict future is slightly overrated, which is why most people don't bother trying
    - People in media are frequently wrong but if you are entertaining and charismatic, no one cares, "often wrong, never in doubt"
    - Even if someone "discovers" something "first", if they can't capitalize and build a moat around it, the rewards goes to the one who can learn/copy fast, iterate quickly and capitalize on the discovery

- Michael Burry, Hank Paulson, Pellegrini all faced moments when others doubted them and they doubted themselves
- It is a bit surprising (but maybe it shouldn't be), how often succesful people deal with self-doubt

- There's no difference between being wrong and being early. Marc Andressen: "When it comes to technology, asumme that everything is going to happen. The interesting question becomes, 'When?'"

- Having conviction when everyone thinks you're wrong [102]

- Heads I win $13, tails I lose $20m/year [tk fact check numbers] [102]
- Doing great work can be very cratifying [106,107]
- Pllegrinis Chart and data cruhcning data [107-109]
- Interesting to see 3 different people reach the exact same conclusion independently

- "No one saw this coming" is often said during a major event but it's rarely true. What you probably mean is, "No one I listen to saw this commin."
    - You should probably update your priors and listen to better people

- Brilliant quote from Keynes [112] [tk add the actual quote]
    - Sidenote: Keynes and Galbraith are top two most quotable economists
    - Honourable mention to Nassim Taleb and Robin Hanson

- interesting anecdote of Ben graham's trading indulgence, I thought he was frugal [113]
- history lesson of all the greats being wrong (Soros, Druckenmiller, Robertson) [115]

- Reference to irrational exuberance which I've read (unfortunately before I started taking book notes [tk add link to my book notes]) [116]
- "Let's hope we are retired and wealthy by the time this house of card falters" - S&P executive 2005 [117]
- Bill Ackman saw this coming in 2002 
    - Question, if you see a crisis coming 5 years before it happens, does it even matter? you can't trade on a thesis that is 5 years out, especially because standing at 2002, you don't know if it's 1 month out or 5 years out?
    - Also, I write this in May 2020 (read the book in March?) in the middle of Covid and Ackman recently went on TV and said that the President should
    "shut everything down"
- Paul Singer and Seth Klarman, two hedge und legends saw it coming but didn't trade more on the housing crash thesis (Not sure what  meant by "trade more").
they considered it a "reputational risk"
- Bill Gross also saw it coming but the culture/structure of his fund (mostly bonds at PIMCO, I believe ) so he was unable to close the deal [120]

- intereting meta takeaway here that it's not enough to just know or see an opportunity, are you agile enough to pounce on that opportunity? Another subtle point, are you willing to be non-conformist, contrarian and handle the "reputational risk" and go against "social norms" to follow a conviction you have?
    - This isn't to suggest that Paul Singer is worried about "social norms" (see: Elliott Management and Argentina bondsd ) but it's speaking to the fact that sometimes people with high reputations can be straightjacketed by their prestige and be less agressive about pursuing opportunities

- innovator's dilemma, all these people saw an opportunity but they couldn't act on it

- Funny Bill Gross quote about how he felt that he couldn't capitalize on the housing Crash [tk add full quote]: "It made me gross, miserable, I couldn't fall asleep" [118]
    - Reminds me about Jeff Bezos quote about the two types of people who passed up on investing Amazon. Some people were still very depressed about it and regretted it deeply. The other group of people realized that sometimes in life, things like that happened and there is no point in wallowing in gregret and realistically to be in a position where you can even pass up on Amazon, you are already incredibly privieleged and have many things to be grateful for.

- I was a bit disappointed there was no mention of Mark Spitznagel (Universa investments) and Nassim Taleb. The whole idea of capped downside, huge upside, is ltierally the entire thesis of Antigragile and Black Swan

    - Antifragile is to Wall Street what Ayn Rand is to Libertarians

- I get the feeling that Paulson's temperament is given 100 simulations, he doesn't get to round 50 before going bust (not sure wht I mean't when I wrote this in my notebook, I am just rewriting here for posterity)

- I prefer Seth Klarman's margin of safety approach

- Though, I admire Paulson's conviction and chutzpah
- This book really motivated me to read Paulson's next book, The Man Who Knew Markets about James Simons and Renaissance Technologies, Gregory Zuckerman is a great writer

- We found the El Dorado of investments

- Funny story about how Pellegrini had to change his email signature, speaks to how status and image conscious Wall Street is (I forget what it was before and what he changed it to)

- Really funny to watch in hindisht all the people who said no [130], James Altucher makes a guest appearance ? [128]
    - What is the modern day equivalent?
