The Greatest Trade Ever by Gregory Zuckerman

- The Greatest Trade Ever is about the 2007/2008 financial crisis and some of the people who made a little bit and a lot of money

- I read this book in February 2020 and I am just getting to it now in May 8 2020, 7 weeks into Covid-19 Quaranting, when a lot of people are trying to decide if now is a good time to buy stocks

- Rereading my notes from this book, I am further convinced that 2008 financial crisis and Covid 19 are drastically different and one should not draw too many conclusions

Some high level takeaways from this book:

- It's not enough to be right, you need to be right at the right time in a very specific way


## Notes

- When you find a great opportunity, be aggressive [90] [95], this is something that Charlie Munger also often says
- Credit Default Swaps have asymettric payoffs. Just like insurance, worst case scenario you pay 1-3% of assets in premium, but if stock price falls you can make 100X your premium payments. Such asymettric payoffs, also exist, e.g entrepreneurship and working for a startup. When you find a good way, take a bet on it [81]

- Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent [99]
- Meta-point about how ability to predict future is slightly overrated, which is why most people don't bother trying
    - People in media are frequently wrong but if you are entertaining and charismatic, no one cares, "often wrong, never in doubt"
    - Even if someone "discovers" something "first", if they can't capitalize and build a moat around it, the rewards goes to the one who can learn/copy fast, iterate quickly and capitalize on the discovery

- Michael Burry, Hank Paulson, Pellegrini all faced moments when others doubted them and they doubted themselves
- It is a bit surprising (but maybe it shouldn't be), how often succesful people deal with self-doubt

- There's no difference between being wrong and being early. Marc Andressen: "When it comes to technology, asumme that everything is going to happen. The interesting question becomes, 'When?'"

- Having conviction when everyone thinks you're wrong [102]

- Heads I win $13, tails I lose $20m/year [tk fact check numbers] [102]
- Doing great work can be very cratifying [106,107]
- Pllegrinis Chart and data cruhcning data [107-109]
- Interesting to see 3 different people reach the exact same conclusion independently

- "No one saw this coming" is often said during a major event but it's rarely true. What you probably mean is, "No one I listen to saw this commin."
    - You should probably update your priors and listen to better people

- Brilliant quote from Keynes [112] [tk add the actual quote]
    - Sidenote: Keynes and Galbraith are top two most quotable economists
    - Honourable mention to Nassim Taleb and Robin Hanson
