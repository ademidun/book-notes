# Amazon.com Get Big Fast by Robert Spector

Amazon.com Get Big Fast[tk add link] by Robert Spector tells the story of Jeff Bezos and how he built Amazon into the world's biggest store with a revolutionary business model that changed the world. My favorite part about this book is that the book was written in 2000, so Amazon was already relatively succesful at this point and Bezos was already a billionaire, but this was still way before things like AWS, Prime, Blue Origin's public launch etc. 

Recently I've found with biographies it's more interesting and informative for me to read the stories about succesful people before they reached their current level, it also helps to avoid the narrative fallacy. Gates[tk add link] by Stephen Manes and Paul Andrews is another such book. I actually started reading Gates and decided to pause and read Get Big Fast instead because I feel like Bezos and Amazon's story is more relatable and applicable to the curent state of tech entreprenurship and my goals at the moment.


## Pre-Amazon: Bezos in high school, Princeton, Startups and DE Shaw

- Bezos has always been fascinated and driven to take humanity to space, his high school girlfriend, Ursular Werner (tk confirm name) accurately predicted blue origin [tk find quote and page]
- Funny game he played with high school girlfriend, basically it was like a scavenger hunt
- Seems to be attracted to smart women, his high school girlfriend was a valedictorian and his ex-wife went to Princeton
- Plot twist: Jeff Bezos High school girlfriend is an attorney in the antitrust division of the United States Justice Department [9] [tk tweet this as a standalone]
- His decision to switch from Physics to Electrical ait's more of an evolhe was the 2nd smartest person in his mathematics class at Harvard (the 1st smartest person is a NY attorney know If I recall correctly). I recall  a joke a professor once made that: "It's a shame Bill Gates hadn't gone into academica, he could have really made something of himself."


- When looking to switch jobs, Bezos told corporate headhunters that he was looking for "second-phase automation" tech companies, "first phase" is doing the same thing that people already do but just in a more efficient manner e.g. barcode scanners or point-of-sale systems, while second phase fundamentally changes how business is done, "it's more of a revolution than an evolution" Bezos says. [16]



### DE Shaw
- A lot of people describe Jeff Bezos as charismatic, which I found surprising I don't mean that in a rude way, but for some reason my biases cause me to asusume that people as smart as Jeff Bezos lack social skills. I guess the truly smart people realize that technical skills will only get you but so far, emotional intelligence is necessary to complete the package[Ursula Werrner, Page 7, Brian Marsh, Page 18]

- I noticed that all the companies he worked for were at the bleeding edge of technology and they were mostly early stage companies or small "intra-startups" within established companies: 
- Similar to my decision to work for a machine-learning, biotech startup because I believe the combination of those 3 fields (machine learning + biotech + startups) are increasingly important parts of our future
- "DE Shaw is a very smart guy. He's one of the few people I know that has a fully developed left brain and a fully developed right brain." Jeff Bezos on his former boss. I always remember this quote because it describes the type of intelligene I aspire to hav [18]


### Origins of Amazon
- Jeff Bezos tried to make a busines plan on how big he thought the company would get and he underestimated by a factor of 10
- Everyone knew Bezos was smart, but it wasn't as obvious then, the true level of his genius was appreciated post-facto, probbly mostly due to the success of Amazon
    - Part of this is due to our society ascribing wealth to intelligence, part of it is that the more successful you are, the more opportunities and access to information you have, further accelerating your personal development and knowledge graph.

### Venture Capitalists
- Jeff Bezos was able to use his network to get VCs like Kleiner Caufield Bryers to invest and got John Doerr on the board
    - John Doerr tried to get Michael Dell on the board
- General Atlantic passed because the valuation was about $30 million more than they were comfortable investing in
- GA Partner, Rajamaratna rationalized saying "investment discipline we win some we lose some", that is smart rationalization because it prevents you from dwelling in Regret
    - However, it should probably be a moment of self-reflection that if you think a company is going to succeed, if it wins or loses, that extra $30 million you are negotiating over won't make a difference either way
- Jeff Bezos was able to own about 40% of the company because he didn't raise too much capital

(tk the following should also be a Twitter thread)
- Some of my rules of thumbs with the most exciting companies to work for:
    - The best companies to work for are companies where the founder is still involved in day-to-day management and operations
    - Where the founders have a controlling stake in the decisions made in the company

- The most exciting companies make make contrarian, non-consensus decisions
- Very hard to do that when decisions are made by committee and there isn't someone with long-term skin in the game

- Inb4 "but what about exception X,Y and Z. This isn't always true",

 yes, this is a generalization, and there are many examples but I still think it's a useful mental model to have for approximating company innovativeness

 Also, doesn't have to be the founder, but there needs to be a single (or small group of) decision-makers with long-term skin in the game

 I'm 80% confident think the aformentioned thread is true 80% of the time. 
 
 However, I reserve the right to change my mind at any time without notice.
