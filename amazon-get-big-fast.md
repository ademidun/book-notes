# Amazon.com Get Big Fast by Robert Spector

Amazon.com Get Big Fast[tk add link] by Robert Spector tells the story of Jeff Bezos and how he built Amazon into the world's biggest store with a revolutionary business model that changed the world. My favorite part about this book is that the book was written in 2000, so Amazon was already relatively succesful at this point and Bezos was already a billionaire, but this was still way before things like AWS, Prime, Blue Origin's public launch etc. 

Recently I've found with biographies it's more interesting and informative for me to read the stories about succesful people before they reached their current level, it also helps to avoid the narrative fallacy. Gates[tk add link] by Stephen Manes and Paul Andrews is another such book. I actually started reading Gates and decided to pause and read Get Big Fast instead because I feel like Bezos and Amazon's story is more relatable and applicable to the curent state of tech entreprenurship and my goals at the moment.


## Pre-Amazon: Bezos in high school, Princeton, Startups and DE Shaw

- Bezos has always been fascinated and driven to take humanity to space, his high school girlfriend, Ursular Werner (tk confirm name) accurately predicted blue origin [tk find quote and page]
- Funny game he played with high school girlfriend, basically it was like a scavenger hunt
- Seems to be attracted to smart women, his high school girlfriend was a valedictorian and his ex-wife went to Princeton
- Plot twist: Jeff Bezos High school girlfriend is an attorney in the antitrust division of the United States Justice Department [9] [tk tweet this as a standalone]
- His decision to switch from Physics to Electrical ait's more of an evolhe was the 2nd smartest person in his mathematics class at Harvard (the 1st smartest person is a NY attorney know If I recall correctly). I recall  a joke a professor once made that: "It's a shame Bill Gates hadn't gone into academica, he could have really made something of himself."


- When looking to switch jobs, Bezos told corporate headhunters that he was looking for "second-phase automation" tech companies, "first phase" is doing the same thing that people already do but just in a more efficient manner e.g. barcode scanners or point-of-sale systems, while second phase fundamentally changes how business is done, "it's more of a revolution than an evolution" Bezos says.

### DE Shaw
- A lot of people describe Jeff Bezos as charismatic, which I found surprising I don't mean that in a rude way, but for some reason my biases cause me to asusume that people as smart as Jeff Bezos lack social skills. I guess the truly smart people realize that technical skills will only get you but so far, emotional intelligence is necessary to complete the package[Ursula Werrner, Page 7, Brian Marsh, Page 18]

- I noticed that all the companies he worked for were at the bleeding edge of technology and they were mostly early stage companies or small "intra-startups" within established companies: 
- Similar to my decision to work for a machine-learning, biotech startup because I believe the combination of those 3 fields (machine learning + biotech + startups) are increasingly important parts of our future
- "DE Shaw is a very smart guy. He's one of the few people I know that has a fully developed left brain and a fully developed right brain." Jeff Bezos on his former boss. I always remember this quote because it describes the type of intelligene I aspire to hav [18]
