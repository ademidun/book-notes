# Thinking in Bets

- "Resulting": Judging a decision based on the result instead on if the process you followed was right. For example, Pete Carrol's decision to pass the ball in 2016 Superbowl [5]
- I disagree with arguement that Pete Carrol had the right decision making proess, the risk-return was asymettric. I think her examples of firing a bad ceo but sales going down or drunk driver getting home safely are better examples of people using resulting, but I get the idea
- Daniel Kahneman, thinking fast and slow system 1 and system 2, similiar to what Dalio said in Principles (see my review) [12]
- Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by John von Neuman and introduction to game theory [19]
- I like how she said that life is like Poker and not chess because in life you have 1. incomplete information 2. Luck
- So in life there is no objectively correct answer and it is not determinsitic [20]
- Clever trick and funny story from The Princess Bride about deception and game theory [23]
- Sometiems it's good to say "I don't know" [26]
- Very interesting analogy about how people said Brexit Bookies were "wrong" because they said Brexit had a 30% chance of happening [32]
- Also, bookmakers don't set odds based on the favorites necessarily, they set odds so that the payoff is such that the losers pay the winners, they remain market neutral and  just take their fee[31]
- Fascinating story on John "Johnny World" Hennigan, who was a poker player in the 1990s that took a bet he could live on a street in Des Moinse, Iowa for a month for $30,000. When he tried to exit the bet, asked **THEM** to pay him $15K, ended up paying $15K to exit the bet. [37]
- Interesting stories and anecdotes of humans not willing to change their mind when they get new information [52, 55]
- Interesting story of the 1951, Princeton vs Dartmouth football game and how both sides suveryed acted like they were pretty much watching two different games, similiar to the Israel-Palestine article and both people interpreted the same story completely differently.
- Fake news has always existed and was practiced by people like Orson Welles, Joseph Pulitzer (yes, the guy they named the Pulitzer prize after), William Randolph Hearst [60]
- The reason it is effective because it is telling you things that you already **WANT** to believe
- Smarter people can be more susceptible to this because, the smarter you are the better you are at rationalizing and construving a narrative frame of whatever you want to believe [62]
- West, Meserve and Stanovich test the blind-spot bias, we are better at detecting flaws in others than in ourselves and the smarter you are, the greater your blind-spot bias [62]
