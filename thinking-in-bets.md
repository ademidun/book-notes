# Thinking in Bets

- "Resulting": Judging a decision based on the result instead on if the process you followed was right. For example, Pete Carrol's decision to pass the ball in 2016 Superbowl [5]
- I disagree with arguement that Pete Carrol had the right decision making proess, the risk-return was asymettric. I think her examples of firing a bad ceo but sales going down or drunk driver getting home safely are better examples of people using resulting, but I get the idea
- Daniel Kahneman, thinking fast and slow system 1 and system 2, similiar to what Dalio said in Principles (see my review) [12]
- Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by John von Neuman and introduction to game theory [19]
- I like how she said that life is like Poker and not chess because in life you have 1. incomplete information 2. Luck
- So in life there is no objectively correct answer and it is not determinsitic [20]
- Clever trick and funny story from The Princess Bride about deception and game theory [23]
- Sometiems it's good to say "I don't know" [26]
- Very interesting analogy about how people said Brexit Bookies were "wrong" because they said Brexit had a 30% chance of happening [32]
- Also, bookmakers don't set odds based on the favorites necessarily, they set odds so that the payoff is such that the losers pay the winners, they remain market neutral and  just take their fee[31]
