# Dataclysm

- Dataclysm is a book by the founder of OkCupid, on what the site's data can tell us about human behaviour, OkCupid is a dating website

- One of my favorite meta takeaways from this book is that directly observing people's behaviours is much more effective than asking them due to the Hawthorne effect

- Essentially, if you ask someone on the phone, "Would you date someone froma different race than you?" some people may lie and say yes, even though they would only date people of the same race. However, if you just observed their behaviour on a dating site and tracked how often they messaged people of opposing races, that would be a lot more instructive

- This can be applied in a wide range of things: e.g. it's currently election season in the US, the polls were notoriously wrong for Trump's election and Brexit. One reason for this is that voting for Trump and Brexit are against social norms so some people were afraid to say they supported Trump or Brexit when asked. But privately they knew they were going to vote for Trump or Brexit. If people had access to Social media analytics (e.g. what % of people in parts of US or UK are Liking anti-immigration posts on FB), I wonder if that would have been predicitive of Trump or Brexit

- A good book related to this phenomenon is Private Truths, Public Lies by Timur Kuran

- There's things that I sort of always intuitively suspected but seeing it in raw data is always a bit surprising [42][43]
- The importance of displaying the right data, page 41 and 42 are showing the same information, but page 42 displays it in a very intuitive way
