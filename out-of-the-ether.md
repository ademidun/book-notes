# Out of the Ether

Out of the Ether is about the history of Ethereum, the $55 Million Hack that almost destroyed it and how it recovered.

## Meta Points about the Book

Matthew Leisig is a really good writer and I enjoy his writing style. It's the type of writing that doesn't take itself too seriously, for example, he'll transition between sentences using phrases like "so anyway" which makes things easier to read and he makes jokes that are actually funny. 

As most people who've written about cryptocureencies for a general audience know, it's almost impossible to explain this industry without using word like private key, decentralized, blockchain and other similar phrases that can cause some people to break into a cold sweat or instantly fall asleep. He does a good job of explaining technical concepts in a way that isn't too complicated. He uses my recommended approach of explaining things with analogies.

## Vitalik's Early Years

Vitalik was identified as gifted from a very early age. He would multiply 3 digit numbers in his head and wrote a 17-page Encyclopedia about Bunnies at age 7. His faterh called it his "first white paper".

His parents were worried that he would get bored of regular school and put him in a special school for Abelard for gifted students. This section speaks to why I'm so passionate about education and especially the education of young people and why I started [Atila](https://atila.ca/). You can draw a very strong correlation between Vitalik's impressive accomplishments now and the strong educational background he has.

While Vitalik was smart, he had a hard time making friends, it wasn't until he got to Abelard where he was intellectually challenged and was around other smart people who enjoyed learning that he really was able to blossom both academically and socially.

Vitalik's education at Abelard reminds me of the early Montessori education of Larry and Sergey (co-founders of Google) and Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon).

The thing that really stood out to me about Vitalik is how strongwell rounded he is. Many people who are math prodigies tend to lack in liberal arts skills such as English. Vitalik was one of the best writers at Abelard and some of his writing was published in the school paper. 

### Vitalik's Parental Influence

Cure the Nature vs Nurture debate.

- Dimitry, Vitalik's dad has done what I think is an excellent way of raising Vitalik, he didn't push him too much but nudged him then and there
- Both his parents were also engineers which probably has a part to play in the genetic lottery of life. 
- His father believed in the Austrian school of Economics and seems to be Libertarian( I also see a lot of merit in Austrian School of Economics, see my notes on [Austrian Quant](https://blog.tomiwa.ca/austrian-quant/) and [Thoughts on Money](https://blog.tomiwa.ca/thoughts-on-money))


## Vitalik and Bitcoin

Vitalik's dad introduces Vitalik to Bitcoin after listening to a [todod: get name of podcast] podcast. At first he dismisses it because it's not backed by anything but then it keeps being brought up

The popular story of how Vitalik started Ethereum because of WoW changing the powers of one of his characters might not have been true. According to his dad, it's because a girl he liked said it was dumb??? [todo get page number]

The section that I found personally interesting is when he started writing about Bitcoin. First as Bitcoin X [todo get name] then at Bitcoin Magazine.

Mihail Alisie has a brilliant quote [todo page number]: 
> I was starting to realized that things happen or don't happen because people do or don't know about it.

This is such an underrated point. The amount of effort that is spent on marketing an idea is super important. Vitalik's writing ability to evangelize the benefits of Ethereum surely played an equally important role as his technical ability.

WOW. Vitalik originally started marketing Bitcoin to teenagers because they were not "tied to current financial system". I literally wrote a blog post [tk add link] talking about why people should start crypto scholarships and I gave the exact same reason. It's pretty cool that I wrote that part of my blog post before I read this section in the book so I guess great minds think alike.
