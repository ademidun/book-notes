# Out of the Ether

Out of the Ether is about the history of Ethereum, the $55 Million Hack that almost destroyed it and how it recovered.

## Meta Points about the Book

Matthew Leisig is a really good writer and I enjoy his writing style. It's the type of writing that doesn't take itself too seriously, for example, he'll transition between sentences using phrases like "so anyway" which makes things easier to read and he makes jokes that are actually funny. 

As most people who've written about cryptocureencies for a general audience know, it's almost impossible to explain this industry without using word like private key, decentralized, blockchain and other similar phrases that can cause some people to break into a cold sweat or instantly fall asleep. He does a good job of explaining technical concepts in a way that isn't too complicated. He uses my recommended approach of explaining things with analogies.

## Vitalik's Early Years

Vitalik was identified as gifted from a very early age. He would multiply 3 digit numbers in his head and wrote a 17-page Encyclopedia about Bunnies at age 7. His faterh called it his "first white paper".

His parents were worried that he would get bored of regular school and put him in a special school for Abelard for gifted students. This section speaks to why I'm so passionate about education and especially the education of young people and why I started [Atila](https://atila.ca/). You can draw a very strong correlation between Vitalik's impressive accomplishments now and the strong educational background he has.

While Vitalik was smart, he had a hard time making friends, it wasn't until he got to Abelard where he was intellectually challenged and was around other smart people who enjoyed learning that he really was able to blossom both academically and socially.

Vitalik's education at Abelard reminds me of the early Montessori education of Larry and Sergey (co-founders of Google) and Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon).

The thing that really stood out to me about Vitalik is how strongwell rounded he is. Many people who are math prodigies tend to lack in liberal arts skills such as English. Vitalik was one of the best writers at Abelard and some of his writing was published in the school paper. 

### Vitalik's Parental Influence

Cure the Nature vs Nurture debate.

- Dimitry, Vitalik's dad has done what I think is an excellent way of raising Vitalik, he didn't push him too much but nudged him then and there
- Both his parents were also engineers which probably has a part to play in the genetic lottery of life. 
- His father believed in the Austrian school of Economics and seems to be Libertarian( I also see a lot of merit in Austrian School of Economics, see my notes on [Austrian Quant](https://blog.tomiwa.ca/austrian-quant/) and [Thoughts on Money](https://blog.tomiwa.ca/thoughts-on-money))


## Vitalik and Bitcoin

Vitalik's dad introduces Vitalik to Bitcoin after listening to a [todod: get name of podcast] podcast. At first he dismisses it because it's not backed by anything but then it keeps being brought up

The popular story of how Vitalik started Ethereum because of WoW changing the powers of one of his characters might not have been true. According to his dad, it's because a girl he liked said it was dumb??? [todo get page number]

The section that I found personally interesting is when he started writing about Bitcoin. First as Bitcoin X [todo get name] then at Bitcoin Magazine.

Mihail Alisie has a brilliant quote [todo page number]: 
> I was starting to realized that things happen or don't happen because people do or don't know about it.

This is such an underrated point. The amount of effort that is spent on marketing an idea is super important. Vitalik's writing ability to evangelize the benefits of Ethereum surely played an equally important role as his technical ability.

WOW. Vitalik originally started marketing Bitcoin to teenagers because they were not "tied to current financial system". I literally wrote a blog post [tk add link] talking about why people should start crypto scholarships and I gave the exact same reason. It's pretty cool that I wrote that part of my blog post before I read this section in the book so I guess great minds think alike.


## Vitalik and Ethereum

- Vitalik Travelling around the world trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life [85]
    - Reminds me of how many prominent people in their 20s were also trying to figure out what to do with their life and travelled while trying to figure that out
    - Benjamin Franklin travelled Europe (Londona and Paris?) in his teens and early 20s
    - Paul Graham travelled Europe (Italy iirc?) and dabbled in art before starting Viacom and YCombinator
    - Ray Dalio and John Paulson, travelled South America before becoming billionaires in the hedge fund industry
    - Steve Job's famous trip to India before starting Apple

- Originally pitched the idea of a smart contract platform to the Colored coins team
- Great quote from Vitalik:

> "Uhh guys are you insane?... This idea is so good you should immediately drop everything you're doing and do this" [91]
- Reminds me of [The Greatest Trade Ever](greatest-trade-ever.md) when the opportunity to profit from mortrage backed securities presented itself to some people and they either didn't recognize the opportunity that was before them or they're current commitments/busines model prevented them from participating
- Paradox on if a token is a security or not [98]

- Vitalik had the idea for Ethereum while going for a long walk in San Francisco in November 2013 [107]
    - A lot of prominent people tend to go on long walks: Nassim Taleb talks about being a flaneur and going for long "strolls" as a source of his creativity
    - I think Paul Graham has also written before about the benefits of going for a walk
    - Femi Falana has a great joke about how but when a rich man is walking, they say he's strolling, but when a poor man is walking, they say he's loitering

- Vitalik talks about loneliness, [108]
> Now that gaining and losing a thousand dollars is just a matter of a few clicks on the Bitcoin price chart, I'm starting to somewhat regret making that choice [of skipping going out for dinner with friends back at the University of Waterloo]... Maybe I would have been considerably less loney had I been willing to let myself spend another $50/month on these kind of things.
- Its interesting to see that someone like Vitalik, who sometimes seems like this out of world person, has human emotions like loneliness
- It seems like this is something that many entrepreneurs experience, I recall Gary Vee, Elon Musk, Kanye West have all described this feeling before
    - I think I recall Kanye and Elon saying this is why they are rarely single for long


- Halo effect around Vitalik [124]
- Stories about the Ethereum house in Miami [126]
    - Frat house vibes
    - Everyone was still utopian and working together, "this was before people hated each other"
    - Vitalik: "Team dynamics is the thing that almost killed Ethereum on multiple occassions" [118]

- Trying to fix the DAO hack literally sounds like a movie, they literally even had a timer [139]


### Vitalik and People

- I want to talk a bit about Vitalik's people skills
- Vitalik gets a lot of credit for his technical prowess but I think his people skills are also extremely important
- I've always believed that in the crypto space we place a lot of value on technical capabilities but human connection is also very important

One of my favorite parts is his thought process when deciding to hire Ming Chan as head of Ethereum foundation:

> I remember being very impressed with Ming because she was the kind of person I could have a three-hour conversation with and enjoy it.

> Gav and Jeff however... found her unimpressive. To them, a person who can laugh and cry is a disadvantage," Vitalik said. "To me, it's an advantage"

They were going to Hire Andrew Laprerieree who had prior experience at International Criminal Court, World Health Organization and UNICEF.  They agreed if his salary conditions were too crazy (over $300k) they would hire Ming. Andre asked for 320,000 while Ming asked for $150,000, so they hired Ming.

When putting together the Ethereum Board, they had hired some very impressive people

> It also showed him that there wasn't much passion for Ethereum in this new group, They weren't really that interested in us or Ethereum," Vitalik Said. "They just saw it as a job." [224]

> I remember during the meeting, looking at the other board member's reaction, the way they were interpreting the information," Vitalik said. "I expected that I would feel warm and safe because there were these high-powered, professional people with lots of experience helping us now. But their body language and mood was like, ugh, huh, okay okay. They were just so clearly not into it. That's when I realized I was not comfortable with them being the board." [225]

> Ming had stayed in touch even though she'd been told her services were no longer required. But Vitalik gew to appreciate her dogged interest in the foundation. This was the sort of passion and dedication to Ethereum and the foundation Vitalik wanted to see [225]

[tk add section about how they all looked to Vitalik to resolve the leadership dispute in Switzerland]



## Growing Ethereum
- Private sale of Ether to raie funds in 2015 [227]
    - 416,667 Ether for $500,000 from some Chinese investors working with Bo Shen

- Ethereum chose to open source their clients using GPL (GNU General Public License) instead of Apache 2 (Apcache License 2.0) [231]
- This made enterprises reluctant to use it because they generally want to maintain propietary rights over the software they create
- Enterprises like JP Morgan, IBM and Microsoft enter the blockchain space around 2016)
- If a group of banks or similar use their own private-public blockchain, (private because the public can't see it but public because all the member banks can see it) They might not need to use Proof of Work, they can just use Proof of Authority or Proof of Stake since all the members (for example, Binance Smart Chain and some of the Ethereum testnets uses Proof of Stake Authority) [254] Ubs uses Proof of Authority [258]
- I remember I first heard about Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2017 and I had an internship at RBC (big bank in Canada) where his team pitched a blockchain project and he had previously worked at IBM and mentioned that IBM was doing some things with crypto
- It's funny because back then I thought it was all vaporware, it's interesting to see the context behind all this now that it's more mainstream
- JP Morgan was trying to decide wether to tweak Ethereum and make it more private or make their own blockchain from scratch, they tried both internally since they weren't sure which one was going to work [256]

- JP Morgan created something called Quorom which used a smart contract that would sit between the main Geth node and the private node to encrypt transactiosn that would be put on the blockchain. Sounds like this is a more primitive version of a rollup? [257]
