# But What If We're Wrong by Chuck Klosterman

Contrarianism is cool right now. This is the best book that I've read on how to be a contrarian thinker.
 But What If We're Wrong is a book about different ideas that are popular in society and offers a contrarian perspective on how we could be wrong.

Peter Thiel says that it's not enough to be contrarian, you have to be contrarian and right. I don't know if Klosterman is necessarily "right" (and to be fair, he's not suggesting a lot of the ideas in the book as being "right") but I think he does an excellent job of creating a new lens on how to think about popular ideas or what I call, "generally accepted accounting stories".

Final  high-level comment about the book: Klosterman is a phenomenal writer. I usually don't praise a writer's writing style because I read mostly non-fiction so I focus more on writing about the contents of the book and the quality of the ideas. I focus on substance and I think I don't appreciate style enough. But I believe in giving credit where credit is due and Klosterman is such a beautiful writer, he has this very sarcastic, dry, British sense of humor which I love so much. Here is one passage as an example:

"The ultimate failure of the United States will probably not derive from the problems we see or the conflicts we wage. It will more likely derive from our uncompromising belief in the things we consider unimpeachable and idealized and beautiful. Because every strength is a weakness, if given enough time." [222]


Paul Graham says that a great way to judge the quality of an idea is by how surprising it is. A great book won't tell you things you already know, but surprise you in many ways. This book might be the most densest book I have read in terms of new/surprising/counterintuitive ideas per page, tied with Nassim Taleb's Antifragile.

The other challenge is that I already am a self-proclaimed contrarian so a lot of the "controversial" ideas he presents in this book were already known to me and seem reasonable-ish but I think the average person reading it would find a lot of the ideas mind opening. H

My guess is that the primary audience for this book can best be described as  "People who liked Malcom Gladwell will also like this book". I think if he takes a Nassim Taleb/Peter Thiel approach and keeps the core thesis of the book but tweaks it to match what wall street and silicon valley types are interested in (money, power, impact) he could actually do very well in that demographic.

My friend recently said to me: "Tomiwa, I look at you and I feel like you have too much entropy". Which means that I am doing too many random things. I am trying to get more focused in my pursuits but this book doesn't help me do that. It presents a lot of various, unrelated ideas together. It's okay because I think books like this which expose you to different contrarian ideas, make you a creative thinkers which is arguably more important.

## Sudden Death Over Time

- Malcolm Gladwell gave a talk and at the end said: "In twenty-five years no one in America will play football and no one in America will eat red meat" [178] The implication being that football is violent and causes concussions etc.

- Then he explains how two things could happen: 

People stop playing team sports in general. The idea is that if sports is just escapism and entertainment it could get replaced by video games and CGI virtual reality. For example, the NCAA college Football bowl games:

When Boling Green played South Alabama in the Camellia Bowl, 20,056 fans were in the stadium but 1.2 million people watched it online. [192] This means that the games should actually be optimized for the TV viewers not the live audience. You could actually end up, playing games in the future in a giant television studio. Especially when you consider that playing Fantasy Football and gambling on games is more popular than watching the actual football games and Vidoe Game industry generates more money than Music and Movies combined [tk add source].

He says this so beautifully [typs and mistakes are my own]
This, obviously, is not something that could (or would happen overnight). Ut wiykd taje nyktuoke decades and multiple generations, and it would require our current socieconomic arc to remain unchanged (which, as I've now latently stated countless times, almost never happens). It also denies the long-held assumption that physical games are a natural manifestation for a species that is fundamentally competitve, and that team sports are simply adult versions of the same impilse that promts any two five-year-olds to race the playfround in order to see who;s faster"

"I mentioned this theory to a friend who works for ESPN, he thought about it for a long time before saying, "I guess I just can't imagine a world where sports don't exist. It would seem like a totally different world. Well, he's right. It would be a totally different world. But different worlds are created all the time, and the world we're currently building does not reasonably intersect with the darker realities of team sports. We want a pain-free world where everyone is the same, even if they are not. That can't happen if we're still jeeping score" [193]

Why does it matter if the people playing the sports are real people?
