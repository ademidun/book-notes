Lebron Inc. is about how Lebron has built his business empire from his Freshman year in St. Vincent St. Mary's in Akron in 2001 (tk verify Lebron high school freshman year) to his new team Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. Brian Windhorst has been following Lebron since 1999 so he is one of the few well known sports media people that has been following Lebron for a long time.

Lebron is my favorite athlete and one of the most influential people on modern culture. I have a lot of respect for all of the things he does off the court, from I-Promise schools to Uninterrupted, to how he posts on Instagram #tacotuesday, I am totally here to #WitnessGreatness. I am also super observant about how aware he is both on the court and off the court. 

I was really excited to read this book. First, a quick story about how I was even able t get this book:


## High School Years (tk add year numbers)

- Lebron grew up extremely poor, the neighborhood he grew up in was actually at the bottom of a hill and they called it "the bottom"
- So many people made a lot of money off Lebron and whenever he tried to make some for himself, people would hound him
- Very funny how things come full circle becasuse he is currenlty in California and is advocating a bill to allow student-athletes to be able to profit from their own likeness.

# Nike, Reebook, Adidas and the Race to Sign Lebron
- Fascinating story about Adidas, Nike and Reebok's competing to sign Lebron [23]
- Reebok offered Lebron the most money ($100 millin)
- Nike offered $88 million  seven-years $77 million with $10 million bonus [51]
- Adidas also made a bid  but pulled out because their representative, Sonny Vacharo offered too much money, he quit shortly after that
- reminds me of my private equity class [tk link note] where we talk about wether or not to invest in a company and my professor always says: "the easiest thing to do is not invest"
- I also think of it in terms of very often with investing: you either win big or it goes to zero
- Either it was a great investment and any amount you paid was a great deal or it is a flop and any amount you paid was too much
- It seems strange to me that Adidas would pull out of a deal because they didn't think Lebron was worth $100 million
- I'm not saying hindsight: I'm saying as long as the valuation is within the same order of magnitude, it shouldn't matter too much
- It's pretty funny that Nike offered Lebron about $10 million less but he still signed with Nike, because he wasn't just think about the upfront money, he was thinking about the backend. Thinking long term about who would provide the most opportunity in the long-term.
- Lebron in 2018: "Signing with Nike, is the best business decision I've ever made" [55]
- I contrast Lebron's decision to sign with Nike decision to Zion Williamson signing with Jordan in 2019. I think Zion signing with Jordan was not the best business decision for him. Outside of Michael Jordan's retro shoes, Jordan shoes don't really sell well, maybe that will change now that they have Zion.

- Nike has a line in its annual report called "Demand Creation Expense" [44]
- This is a catchall term for all endorsement, marketing, advertising related expenses
- Nike usually keeps that number around 11 to 12 percent of revenue
- So if they offer Lebron an $85 million contract, they expected to make about $850 million
- I've always said that despite how large the contract amounts seem, businesses offer you that much because they know they can make at least double that
- I never knew that they expected to make 10 times what they offered you!
- Though to be fair,$850 million is a big business, most people including Adidas CEO Herbert Hainer, and Nike CEO, Phil Knight were unsure if Lebron could generate that much revenue

- Also signed a multi-year package Upper Deck for $6 million [49]
- His rookie contract was [$4 million](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/lebron-james-2257/cash-earnings/)
- This is lowkey a very important statistic, that Lebron is making off the court 3 times what he's making for actually playing the game
- Really goes to show that in modern society (and perhaps its always been like this), attention is the most valuable asset
- I talk about this in the age of the superhuman [tk link to talk]
- Amazing story about how 18-year old Lebron turned down a million cheque from Reebok
- The crazy part was all this was hapenning while him and his mom were still poor, how many 18-year olds would turn down that kind of money
- His rational was "If this is what Reebok is offering me, imagine what Nike and Adidas have to offer?"
