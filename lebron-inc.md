# Lebron Inc.


Lebron Inc. is about how Lebron has built his business empire from his Freshman year in St. Vincent St. Mary's in Akron in 2001 (tk verify Lebron high school freshman year) to his new team Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. Brian Windhorst has been following Lebron since 1999 so he is one of the few well known sports media people that has been following Lebron for a long time.

Lebron is my favorite athlete and one of the most influential people on modern culture. I have a lot of respect for all of the things he does off the court, from I-Promise schools to Uninterrupted, to how he posts on Instagram #tacotuesday, I am totally here to #WitnessGreatness. I am also super observant about how aware he is both on the court and off the court. 

I was really excited to read this book. First, a quick story about how I was even able t get this book:


## High School Years (tk add year numbers)
- Lebron grew up extremely poor, the neighborhood he grew up in was actually at the bottom of a hill and they called it "the bottom"
- So many people made a lot of money off Lebron and whenever he tried to make some for himself, people would hound him
- Very funny how things come full circle becasuse he is currenlty in California and is advocating a bill to allow student-athletes to be able to profit from their own likeness.
