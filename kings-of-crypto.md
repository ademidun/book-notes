The history of Coinbase and how Brian Armstrong built Coinbase into one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.

- Brian underestimating China, Chinese audience felt like he was lecturing them despite them building larger exchanges than Coinbase [82]
- Brian's tendency to communicate via blogs, very similar to what Vitalik does [81]
- "Coinbase is just an onramp to Binance" [181]
  - This mirrors my experience, I bought my first crypto on Coinbase but switched to other exchanges that had more features
  - CZ Zhao, "I prefer places like Malta where I can call the Prime minister directy" [180]
- Quote from Emin Gun Sirer [214]:

> Sirer has another observation about the future of the crypto industry: 
> As long as the industry is driven by speculation, he says, 
it will be exchanges-Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Gemini-that occupy the most prominent place in crypto. 
> But as the industry matures and tokens become part of the financial mainstream, 
it could be companies that offer other services-loans, investment advice, or consulting that become its face.
