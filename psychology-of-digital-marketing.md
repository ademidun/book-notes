# Psychology of Digital Marketing

I watch a lot of videos on Youtube. I have never felt compelled to actually take the time to write a review of a video I have watched until coming across Rory Surtherland's talk on the psychology of digital marketting. Don't be fooled by the title, this talk is really about the psychology of humans and life. If that sounds like an ambitious title, that is just the beginning.

Humans don't try to understand reality, we try to survive.

For example, the color purple doesn't actually exist. It's our brain trying to interpret us coming across a color that Rory calls 'essentially not green'.
