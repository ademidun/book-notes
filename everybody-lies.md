# Everybodby Lies by Seth Stephenes-Davidowitz


Everybodby Lies by Seth Stephenes-Davidowitz is about all the different things we can learn from studying Google and internet data instead of relying as opposed to relying on traditional polling methods.

The premise of this book is very interesting because as I write this the US election is 7 days away and many people are worried that the polls are unreliable. Which got me wondering, is Google the only company in the world that has the best data on who is most likely to win the election? 

- "sexless relationship" is 3 times more popular than abusive relationshio
- "sexless marriage" is 8 times more popular than loveless marriage

Btw, I listened to this book via audiobook so most of my numbers might be wrong and it's too hard to go back and check, just interpret any mention of "X is N times more than Y" as "X is more than Y".

- When Obama became president there were more searches for "first N---er president" than "first black president"

- Author also mentioned something about popularity of search terms with "n---er jokes" or "stupid n---er" and that this doesn't include rap lyrics which often use the term "n---a"


- Searching how to vote is accurate for predictiong voter tunrout [19:30] 

- Queries include both candidates name: some ssearched "Trump Clinton polls" other searched "Clinton trump polls"
- 12% of Trump queries also included clinton more than 25% of Clinton also included Trump, order in which Candidate suggests first might be a clue to who people would vote for
- in previous 3 elections, whoever appeared first predited who won
- More interestingly it predicted which way a state would go (how accurate was it? how many states out of 50 did they get right?)

- It's very good at seperating stated vs revealed preferences, especially for people like Trump who has a lot of closet supporters
- Apparently black people said they would turn out to vote against Trump

- Major clue was all that secret racism according to Seth

- The book is very good but life is too messy for trying to create a simple Narrative
- I hope I'm not strawmanning him but he seems to imply: Trump won because of closet racism, but if that is true then how come Obama on in 2008?
- The less concise but more accurate reason is: "Some people voted for Trump because of racism, some people voted for him because of other reasons. The same way if it rains, some people won't vote. There's too many reasons why people support certain candidates
- Strongest correlation with people that support Trump is places that had the most searches for "n---er"
