# Everybodby Lies by Seth Stephenes-Davidowitz


Everybodby Lies by Seth Stephenes-Davidowitz is about all the different things we can learn from studying Google and internet data instead of relying as opposed to relying on traditional polling methods.

The premise of this book is very interesting because as I write this the US election is 7 days away and many people are worried that the polls are unreliable. Which got me wondering, is Google the only company in the world that has the best data on who is most likely to win the election? 

- "sexless relationship" is 3 times more popular than abusive relationshio
- "sexless marriage" is 8 times more popular than loveless marriage

Btw, I listened to this book via audiobook so most of my numbers might be wrong and it's too hard to go back and check, just interpret any mention of "X is N times more than Y" as "X is more than Y".

- When Obama became president there were more searches for "first N---er president" than "first black president"

- Author also mentioned something about popularity of search terms with "n---er jokes" or "stupid n---er" and that this doesn't include rap lyrics which often use the term "n---a"
