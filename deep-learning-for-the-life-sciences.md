# Deep Learning for the Life Sciences

If you want to become very rich or help a lot of people in the future, I recommend learning data science and biology. More specifically deep learning and genetics. I recently bought a book about deep learning and genetics.

## Introduction Life Science is Data Science

- The book begins by talking about how modern life sciences is increasingly driven by data science and algorithms
- As I have mentioned earlier, it's not so much that the algorithms we have are more sophisticated, it's that we now have access to smarter computers
- Put mroe bluntly, the computers have gotten way smarter, we on the other hadm have gotten marginally smarter at best.
