# The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt

The righteous mind by Jonathan Haidt is about why people with good intentions disagree on topics like politics and religion. It's a puzzle that I have found especially interesting in the last few years.

I listened to this book as an Audio Book so my notes aren't as detailed as they usually are and they do not have page numbers do the fact that I listened to this book as opposed to reading it.
